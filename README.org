* Math++
  
  A library to provide basic mathematical notions to C++. The main purpose is to establish a fixed interface of each mathematical construct with a C++ concept. The defined concepts strictly follow definitions on Wikipedia hopefully to the extend that no additional documentation is needed. 


* Things to consider implementing 


** Forgetful functor via class inheritance structure

   There should be inheritance structure
   `Vec : Set : Cat`
   `Vec::Object : Set::Object : Cat::Object`
   `Vec::Morphism : Set::Morphism : Cat::Morphism`
   which would give us automatically forgetful functors `Vec -> Set -> Cat`

   More general for any category `A` and `B` if we implement inheritance structure
   `B : A`
   `B::Object : A::Object`
   `B::Morphism : B::Morphism`
   then we get forgetful functor `B -> A` for free

** LaTeX symbols for categories, objects and morphisms

   Potentially automatically generate diagrams
